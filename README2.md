# How to Build The Perfect Sandwich
There are so many unlimited options for creating a sandwhich and it's hard to choose just one. The perfect sandwhich depends on the craving. It's close to impossible to mess up on a sandwhich.

## The Bread
There are so many different options to start your sandwich off:
* **White**
* **Wheat**
* **SourDough**
* **Croissant**
* **Baguette**



## Savoury or Sweet
Your sandwhich can go in either two directions: **savoury** or **sweet**. You can make a classic *grilled cheese* or a *peanut butter and jelly*. The possibilities are endless.

## Different Fillings
The filling combinations can make or break your sandwich. So ***choose wisely***. Some of my favorites include:

* **Peanut Butter and Honey**
* **CreamCheese and Cucumber**
* **Poultry with cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, mayo, and chipotle sauce**

## Hot or Cold
Are we toasting our bread, making our cheese ooey gooey, or are we having it cold. You can never go wrong with any of those options. It depends on your preference.
